BY: WILLIAM RAY, Author of the contemplated publication, entitled, “Horrors of Slavery, or the American Turf in Tripoli,” VOTARIES of Freedom, arm! The British Lion roars! Legions of Valor, take th’ alarm—; Rash, rush to guard our shores! Behold the horrid deed— Your brethren gasping lie! Beneath a tyrant’s hand they bleed— They groan—they faint—they die. Veterans of seventy-six, Awake the slumbering sword;— Hearts of your murderous foes transfix— 'Tis vengeance gives the word. Remember Lexington, And Bunker’s tragic hill; “The same who spilt your blood thereon, Your blood again would spill. Ye who have seen your wives, Your children, and your fires, Too British ruffians yield their lives, And roast in savage fires;— Our cities lost in flames,— Your mothers captive led; Rise and avenge their injured names, Ye kindred of the dead. But not Revenge alone, Should urge you to the field; Let Duty lead you firmly on, And justice be your shield. Sure as we fail to join And crush our impious foes, War, fire and sword, and death combine, And woes succeed to woes.\n",
